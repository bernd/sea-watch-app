Sea-Watch Safe Passage Userguide

# About
Safe Passage is an app designed to coordinate emergency calls from people who are in distress in the Mediterranean. It basically consists of a geographic information system linked to a database in which emergency cases can be stored with all necessary information like coordinates, condition of the boat or people on board. By analysing the location and comparing it to the operation areas of different helping organisations, the responsible rescue vehicle can be found. Safe Passage also allows tracking cases and rescue vehicles. 
Emergency cases can either be entered through a web form in Safe Passage or two corresponding apps, the Sea Watch Safe Passage Search & Rescue App or the Sea Watch Spotter App.

This user guide will help you with your first steps in Safe Passage.

# Get Access



# Create a New Case (web form)
Creating a new case through the web form in Safe Passage is very easy. Just click "Create New Case" in the dark grey menu bar at the top and the web form will open up. Fill in the information you have on the new case. It is important that you enter the location of the boat (geographic coordinates in decimal degrees) - otherwise the case cannot be matched to the responsible vehicle and the error "no_operation_area" will occur. If everything went well and your case was created, the notification "case created" pops up.

# Display Modes

###### Map display mode
The map gives you an overview of the locations of all cases and vehicles. Zoom in and out by using the tool in the top left corner of the map. It is also possible to zoom in by double clicking. To move the map click and hold the left mouse button and drag the map to a new place. Cases are indicated in blue, vehicles in different other colours. By hovering over the cases or vehicles, you will see the corresponding ID number. By clicking on one of the cases, the corresponing case box will open up on the right-hand side of your screen. By clicking on one of the cases or vehicles, you will be able to see the date and time it has been tracked first and last. If a vehicle or a case has moved while it was tracked, the tracking line appears on the map as well. 

###### Cases display mode
In this display mode you can see all the cases currently stored in the database, sorted according to the date they were added. Each case has its corresponding case box. Red case boxes are for boats in distress, orange ones for cases in progress, blue ones for rescued boats and green ones for cases on land. Above each case box, you can see when it was added.

###### Vehicles display mode


###### Telephone Watchers display mode


# Filtering
The menu on the left-hand side allows you to filter your displayed items (cases, vehicles or telephone watchers depending on the display mode you are in). For example, in the Cases display mode, you can filter the cases according to their Area, Status and Sources. By selecting the status 'Distress' you will see all cases that still need to be rescued at a glance. As long as no item in the menu is selected, all cases are displayed, also older ones which have already been rescued.
