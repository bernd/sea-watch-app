###### Double entries
One question that is frequently asked is that of double entries. What happens if a case is entered multiple times, for example via the web form and the Spotter App? The Safe Passage system does not contain an algorithm to avoid this (yet). Literally, we recommend following the proverb "better safe than sorry" and appeal to the intelligence of the Safe Passage users. 

###### What happens once a new case is created?
We are still working on this question and aim at ensuring a reliable and responsible procedure.
